* sally.cfg : configuration file for the [sally](http://www.mlsec.org/sally/) tool 
* stoptokens.txt : to eliminate 00 and ?? 
* preprocess.sh and preprocess\_test.sh : for preprocessing .bytes files
* MalwareFeatExtAndViz.ipynb : notebook to experiment with feature extraction, t-SNE and plots 
* FeatSelectionTrainTest.ipynb : notebook that we used to generate the testing instances predictions using a t-SNE + SVM classifier 
* MalwareFeatureExtraction-spark-databricks.ipynb : notebook that we used on [databricks](https://databricks.com/) to experiment with a pyspark implementation.
* test_instances_predictions.csv : the predictions file of our late submission to [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification) (logloss = 0.1719). (A no-clue classifier scores 2.1972)
